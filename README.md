## Welcome to Transmute

Transmute is a binary that works alone or in coordination with coverage formatter to report test quality. It will change your code and make the tests fail. If don't, we will raise it for you.

Any software requires well-written tests. You should catch errors when API changes for example or maybe a library update. This is where transmute steps in.

The key features of transmute are:

* **Mutate**: Arbitrary code can be changed.
  Mutates booleans, numbers, strings, symbols, ranges, regexes and branches (if, while, unless, until)
  can be changed in order to make your specs fail.

* **Dynamic**: Transmute will run the tests for you
  Provide how to run the tests and transmute will run it.

* **Coverage**: Transmute will run just the affected tests.
  Instead of running all the specs, we will run only the required specs.
  This is good to provide a quick feedback-loop.

* **Insigts**:
  If the tests didn't fail, we will provide the information that you need
  to write a new tests case.

## Getting Started

```sh
$ transmute run \
  --file="**/*.rb" \
  --coverage="coverage.json" \
  --command="docker exec rspec"
```

## Coverage file (optional)

Coverage is a file generated by the coverage formatter. We are building integration for the most used test libraries.

It is a good practice to provide the `coverage.json` file. It is very simple: For each implementation file, we have all the specs that touches it.
With that in hand, we don't need to run all specs in order to test one constant mutation.
